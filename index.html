    <title>Bellabeat Data Analysis Project</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The Bellabeat data analysis project focuses on analyzing user data to gain insights and inform marketing strategies for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Through my analysis, I will extensively explore relationships and patterns within historical health tech data. My aim is to use my findings, along with research papers and industry reports, to develop a new data-backed marketing strategy for Bellabeat's stakeholders.</p>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>SQL Cleaning &amp; Manipulation Markdown</li>
        <li>R Manipulation, Analysis &amp; Visualizations Markdown</li>
        <li>Correlation &amp; Regression Markdown</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Source</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains personal tracker data from 30 Fitbit users who consented to share their data.</li>
        <li>The data includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.</li>
        <li>The dataset spans from April 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016, providing a single month of data.</li>
        <li>For this project I used 10 out of 18 CSV files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The datasets have been stored locally in a folder named bellabeat_export_4.12.16-5.12.16 &amp; duplicated for retention of the original data prior to cleaning and manipulation.</li>
        <li>Files were uploaded to BigQuery with new table names recorded within documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <h3>Data Limitations and Considerations</h3>
    <p>The dataset used in this analysis spans from April 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016, providing only one month of data. This limited timeframe may restrict the scope and generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the 30 user sample size is small, and the methods of participant selection through Amazon Mechanical Turk are not detailed on Kaggle, which introduces potential bias into the analysis. It is also important to note that the data is from 2016 and may not reflect the most recent trends or user behaviors. Furthermore, the lack of demographic information limits the depth and context of the insights that can be derived from this analysis.</p>

    <h3>Consistency</h3>
    <p>Although the Fitbit Fitness Tracker Dataset description claims that thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the use of their data, 33 distinct IDs were found within the records during exploration.</p>
    <p>The weightlog table was the most explicit example of this dataset's challenges and was subsequently dropped:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Incomplete data: Only 8 unique IDs, which may not provide a comprehensive view of user behavior and patterns.</li>
        <li>Missing values: High number of null values in the Fat column, suggesting unreliable data capture or reporting.</li>
        <li>Relevance: Weight data was not considered a major variable for the analysis.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Datetime Formatting</h3>
    <p>While uploading the CSVs into BigQuery there was an error uploading hourlycalories, hourlyintensities, sleepday, weightlog due to issues with datetime formatting. This was resolved within google sheets. I renamed each changed file with v2.</p>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There is a strong positive correlation between total steps and calories burned for both weekdays and weekends. As total steps increase, calories burned also tends to increase.</li>
        <li>There is a strong positive correlation between very active minutes and calories burned for both weekdays and weekends. As very active minutes increase, calories burned also tends to increase.</li>
        <li>There is a significant negative correlation between sedentary minutes and total time in bed for both weekdays and weekends. As total time in bed increases, sedentary minutes tend to decrease.</li>
        <li>On average, people exercise with the greatest intensity during afternoon workouts, followed by mornings, with the lowest intensity in the evenings.</li>
        <li>On average, people take more steps during the afternoon, followed by mornings, with the lowest step count in the evenings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Target Market</h2>
    <p>Bellabeat's target market comprises health-conscious, tech-savvy women who prioritize a holistic approach to wellness. They value integrating health into their daily lives, aligning their routines with their menstrual cycles, and being part of a supportive community. These women appreciate innovative, data-driven solutions and stylish, functional products, spanning a diverse age range from young adults to older women.</p>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Leverage the strong positive correlation between steps and calories burned by incorporating gamification elements into Bellabeat's apps and products. Develop personalized step challenges and rewards that align with each user's fitness level and goals, taking into account their cycle phases and other biometric data. This approach can motivate users to increase their physical activity and improve overall health outcomes while catering to the unique needs of women.</li>
        <li>Implementing a social network element to bellabeats app could leverage our target market, social connections and encourage current users to invite family and friends, possibly creating new memberships.</li>
        <li>A social hub could be a place to manage promotional events, challenges and possible rewards via partnerships. According to "Incentive-Based Interventions for Health-Related Behaviors" Implementing finely crafted financial or non-financial incentives based on users' performance can further motivate behavior change. For example, providing discounts or coupons for reaching activity milestones could be an effective strategy.</li>
        <li>Create dynamic challenges based on continuous data analysis. For example, since the case study revealed that the highest exercise intensity is in the afternoon, a challenge involving early morning activities could be introduced for a week, offering a new and engaging challenge for the community.</li>
        <li>Conduct a larger-scale study with a diverse, representative sample of Bellabeat's target audience to gain deeper insights into their needs, preferences, and behaviors. Use this data to refine product features, marketing strategies, and content offerings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Relevant Studies</h2>
    <h3>"Gamification for health promotion: systematic review of behaviour change techniques in smartphone apps" (BMJ Open)</h3>
    <p>Summary:</p>
    <p>This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of gamification elements in smartphone health apps for promoting healthy behaviors. It identifies key gamification strategies such as badges, leaderboards, competitions, rewards, and avatars that have been shown to motivate users and sustain engagement. The study emphasizes the use of behavior change techniques like goal setting, feedback, and social connectivity, which align with established health behavior change theories.</p>

    <h3>"Changing health behaviors using financial incentives: a review from behavioral economics" (BMC Public Health)</h3>
    <p>Summary:</p>
    <p>This study reviews the effectiveness of financial incentive schemes in promoting health-related behaviors. It emphasizes the importance of well-designed incentive programs, highlighting behavioral economics principles like loss aversion and immediate rewards. Key findings include that incentives tied to immediate outcomes and framed as losses can be more motivating than those framed as gains.</p>
