# Bellabeat Data Analysis

## Introduction
The Bellabeat data analysis project focuses on analyzing user data to gain insights and inform marketing strategies for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Through my analysis, I will extensively explore relationships and patterns within historical health tech data. My aim is to use my findings, along with research papers and industry reports, to develop a new data-backed marketing strategy for Bellabeatâ€™s stakeholders.
